    "Understanding this structure is crucial because:\n",
    "- real applications must **parse and inspect responses**, not just print them;\n",
    "- advanced workflows (logging, filtering, ranking, evaluation) all depend on it."

    "## ✅ Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we moved one step closer to using Large Language Models **consciously** rather than mechanically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of treating the model output as plain text, we explored the **structure of the API response** and learned where the generated content actually lives. This shift in perspective is essential: when working with LLMs in real applications, understanding the response format matters as much as writing a good prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression `response.choices[0].message.content` is not an arbitrary access pattern, but the final step of a well-defined data structure designed to support multiple outputs, metadata, and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point on, every interaction with an LLM API should be seen as:\n",
    "- a request to a service,\n",
    "- a structured response,\n",
    "- and a deliberate extraction of the information we need."
