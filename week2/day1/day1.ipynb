    "# LLMs Q&A Challenge 💬\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to compare the behavior of **multiple Large Language Models (LLMs)** under the same prompts, reusing code and concepts introduced in Week 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, four models are compared: gpt-5-nano, llama3.2, gemini-2.5-pro, and deepseek-r1:1.5b\n",
    "\n",
    "The “challenge” consists of asking each model **the same set of questions**, including:\n",
    "- deliberately **nonsensical or ambiguous** prompts,\n",
    "- **metalinguistic** requests (e.g., word counting),\n",
    "- **abstract descriptive** questions,\n",
    "- **self-reflective** questions about the model’s own capabilities and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is not to identify a “winner,” but rather to observe **qualitative differences** in how models interpret, handle, and respond to the same input.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the notebook correctly, the following are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The following API keys (when required by the selected models):\n",
    "  - OpenAI API key\n",
    "  - Google Gemini API key\n",
    "- Ollama installed and running locally for locally executed models\n",
    "  (e.g., `ollama serve` from the terminal)\n",
    "\n",
    "API keys must be loaded via a `.env` file, as shown in the previous notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing the responses, it is important to keep in mind several key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Same prompt ≠ same context**\n",
    "  Even with identical textual input, models operate under different conditions:\n",
    "  tokenizers, implicit system prompts, safety policies, and generation strategies are not uniform. These factors directly affect the structure and content of the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nonsense questions and handling of absurdity**\n",
    "  Intentionally meaningless prompts make it possible to observe whether a model:\n",
    "  - attempts to “invent” an answer anyway (hallucination),\n",
    "  - explicitly signals that the question has no meaning,\n",
    "  - freely reinterprets or reformulates the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instability of metalinguistic requests**\n",
    "  Questions such as *“How many words are there in your answer to this question?”* are inherently unstable:\n",
    "  word counts may vary depending on punctuation, spacing, reformulations, and even on different versions of the generated response.\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations help illustrate that LLM behavior does not depend solely on model “power,” but also on **architectural and design choices** that are often invisible to the end user.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌐 External reference\n",
    "\n",
    "For those interested in seeing language models tested in a more playful setting, there is also an interesting and entertaining project available at:\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 https://edwarddonner.com/outsmart/\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a game of **strategy and diplomacy** in which different LLMs compete directly, revealing how strategies, alliances, and communication failures emerge depending on the model being used. This provides a compelling example of LLM comparison beyond a purely technical context.\n"
